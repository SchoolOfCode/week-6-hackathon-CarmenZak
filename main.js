//Test 2 - Find the secret code!

// Congratulations on making it this far! You have to find the code to open the portal. How? You need to find the secret number hidden in the secret array. 
// Write a function that returns all of the odd integers in the hidden array concatenated together as one 7 digit integer.
//The portal code will appear in the terminal once you've run the tests. Good luck! 


export function secretNumber(secretArray) {

//insert your code here

};
